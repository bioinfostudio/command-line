    ## The root directory
    
    Let's change directory to the root directory, and then into our home directory
    
    ```bash
    inner$ cd /
    /$ cd home
    home$ cd bioinfo
    ~$
    ```
    
    In this case, we may as well have just changed directory in one go:
    ```bash
    cd /home/bioinfo/
    ```
    
    The leading `/` is incredibly important. The following two commands are very different:
    
    ```bash
    cd /home/bioinfo/
    cd home/bioinfo/
    ```
    
    The first command says go the `bioinfo` directory that is beneath the `home` directory that is at the top level (the root) of the file system. There can only be one `/home/bioinfo` directory on any Unix system.
    
    The second command says go to the `bioinfo` directory that is beneath the `home` directory that is located wherever I am right now. There can potentially be many `home/bioinfo` directories on a Unix system (though this is unlikely).
    
    Learn and understand the difference between these two commands.
