    ## Counting characters, words and lines in a file
    
    ```bash
    learning_unix$ ls
    opening_lines.txt
    
    learning_unix$ ls -l
    total 4
    -rw-r--r-- 1 biofino biofino 0 Dec  2 09:09 opening_lines.txt
    
    learning_unix$ wc opening_lines.txt
    2  7 42 opening_lines.txt
    
    learning_unix$ wc -l opening_lines.txt
    2 opening_lines.txt
    ```
    
    The `ls -l` option shows us a long listing, which includes the size of the file in bytes (in this case '42'). Another way of finding this out is by using Unix's [wc][wc command] command (word count). By default this tells you many lines, words, and characters are in a specified file (or files), but you can use command-line options to give you just one of those statistics (in this case we count lines with `wc -l`).
