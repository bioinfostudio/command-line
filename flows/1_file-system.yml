# This is a YAML comment, which is entirely ignored.

# YAML files in Relate are preprocessed with Jinja2.
# See http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/latest/templates/ for syntax.

# This brings in a helper function that is used to include pages from
# separate files. This is optional, but conceivably useful.

# The "|" character introduces a 'block literal', which means all text indented below
# it is taken literally. The description property holds text marked up with 'Markdown'.
# See https://documen.tician.de/relate/content.html#relate-markup for more.
#
# So the '#' character below introduces a first-level headline (not a comment).
